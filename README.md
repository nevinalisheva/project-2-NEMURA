# NEMURA

It's our second project at Wild Code School that we created in a month's time. We used all our knowledge of React, JavaScript, and CSS. It was possible to implement that with the API from www.tvmaze.com.

## General info

NEMURA is a web application that allows you to search for any TV show and get detailed information about its actors, seasons, episodes, and overall rating. Whether you are looking for your next binge-worthy series or simply want to know more about your favorite shows, NEMURA makes it easy to find what you are looking for. The app is fast, responsive and user-friendly.

## Features

* "Search bar" is where you can search for an exact TV show
* "My Favourites" page is created to allow you to save your favourite TV shows in one place
* "Top 50 series" - if you don't know what to watch, you can look for top-rated TV shows of all times
* "Quotes" are there to display every time a new quote from a random TV show 
* "NEMURA's TOP" was added to make our website more unique by displaying TV shows based on our recommendations

The design we used matches all resolutions and screen sizes.
